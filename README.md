## **Vision**

The Tokenized Educational Scavenger Hunt is designed to merge education with the cutting-edge world of blockchain technology. By gamifying the learning experience, this project enables participants to explore educational content through a series of clues, where solving each clue unlocks a blockchain-based token as a reward. This not only makes learning interactive and fun but also introduces participants to the basics of blockchain and digital assets, promoting digital literacy in an engaging way.
